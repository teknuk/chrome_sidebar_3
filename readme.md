import { url } from './settings'

if (Frame.isReady()) {
  Frame.toggle()

}
```

## Getting Started

Download [an example](https://github.com/teknuk/chrome_sidebar_3/tree/manifest_v3/examples/github-trending/) or [clone the repo](https://github.com/teknuk/chrome_sidebar_3.git):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/teknuk/chrome_sidebar_3/tar.gz/manifest_v3 | tar -xz --strip=2 chrome_sidebar_3-manifest_v3/examples/github-trending
cd github-trending
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For development, you need to load it as an unpacked extension:

Now, you should have a chrome sidebar extension on all of your pages!

## Production

In order to share your extension with others, [publish to the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish). You can keep the extension unlisted (no one can search for it) or [private](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860?hl=en) (people have to be added to a Google group to see it).
